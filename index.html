                        <p>
                            Hello there, I'm Nicki, though you can call me NickiBreeki if you'd like.<br>
                            I'm an <span class="Age"></span>-year-old Asian gal with a knack for game programming, and currently, I'm immersed in the world of Roblox development.<br>
                            <br>
                            I've been honing my programming skills for a good 5-7 years now, starting way back in 2012 when I was just 10.<br>
                            It's been quite the journey, and along the way, I've developed a sharp eye for the finer details and a genuine passion for crafting games that truly captivate and entertain players.<br>
                            <br>
                            Programming isn't my only talent, though! I've also dabbled in animation for about a year.<br>
                            My primary focus is on animating weapons in R6 packages because I find the challenge of animating R15 to be quite invigorating.<br>
                            <br>
                            When it comes to role models in the programming world, <a href="https://twitter.com/@SDGNelson"><i class="ri-twitter-line"></i> Nelson Sexton</a>, aka <a href="https://smartlydressedgames.com/"><i class="ri-pages-line"></i> SmartlyDressedGames</a>, stands out as a big inspiration for me.<br>
                            I aspire to follow in his footsteps and continue crafting innovative and captivating games that players will absolutely love.<br>
                            <br>
                            Thanks a bunch for taking the time to peruse my portfolio. I genuinely hope you enjoy delving into my work! 😊

                        <p>
                            When it comes to payments, our products are typically priced between $30 and $60 (USD), which I believe offers a pretty good deal.
                            Some other folks out there are charging more than $60 for similar services.<br><br>

                            Right now, I'm happy to accept a few payment methods, including;<br>
                            • ROBLOX Currency (Robux)<br>
                            • ROBLOX Limited items<br>
                            • Discord Nitro with Booster (Gift)<br>
                            • US Dollars<br><br>

                            Just a heads-up, <b>if you choose to pay with ROBLOX Currency, you'll find that Roblox Taxes are already included in the total.</b><br>
                            For <b>payments in US Dollars, it's worth mentioning that you'll need a credit card</b> because my current bank account is with Stripe, not PayPal.
                            
                            Hope that clears things up for you!
                        </p>
